# GitHub Actions Deployment Workflow

This project demonstrates a simple **Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)** setup using **GitHub Actions** to deploy a static website to **GitHub Pages**.

### Workflow Overview
- Any change to the `index.html` file on the `main` branch triggers a GitHub Actions workflow.
- The workflow builds (if necessary) and deploys the site to GitHub Pages automatically.

### Deployed URL
